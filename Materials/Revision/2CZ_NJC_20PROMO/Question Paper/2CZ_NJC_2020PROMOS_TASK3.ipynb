    "# Task 3: Visitor Management System\n",
    "A Visitor Management System for a hospital is to be developed to manage visitors visiting patients in the hospital. A vital component of the system is the queuing system used to control and manage the number of visitors that are allowed to visit a patient at any one time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The queuing system is to be developed using an OOP approach with the following requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A 1-D array is to be used to model the beds in the hospital. The size of the array is the number of beds in the hospital. Each element in the array will contain a Bed object.\n",
    "- Each bed in the hospital is uniquely identified by its floor, ward and bed number. The floor number, ward number and bed number start at 1. The number of floors, number of wards per floor and the number of beds per ward is given during the initialisation of the Hospital class.\n",
    "- Each Bed object has a Queue object that is use to manage the visitors waiting to visit the patient in the hospital room. The maximum queue size is **10**.\n",
    "- The **highest** floor in the hospital is reserved for intensive care patients and all the beds have a restricted visiting hour from 1700 to 1900 inclusive, every day. **All the rest** of the beds have visiting hours between 1200 to 2000 inclusive.\n",
    "- All visitors making a visit will need to provide his/her name, contact number the patient's floor, ward and bed number he/she is visiting. If the visit is within the valid visitation hours, the visitor will be placed in the queue for the room.\n",
    "- The system will automatically inform the visitor via a SMS (short message service) message when the visitor is allowed to visit the patient and the visitor's record will be dequeued from the system. (NOTE: You **do not need** to implement this feature)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The following class diagrams are to be used in your implementation, you may **include** any **additional classes** and **add** any **helper methods** or **attributes** that you deemed necessary:\n",
