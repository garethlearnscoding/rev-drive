    "* The character 'A' has the ASCII value 65. Adding 10 to the number will give the ASCII value 75. The character for 75 is 'K'.\n",
    "* When an uppercase letter's code goes beyond 'Z' it returns to 'A' For example, the character 'Z' has the ASCII value 90. Adding 10 to the number will give the ASCII value 74. The character 'Z' will be encrypted as 'J'.\n",
